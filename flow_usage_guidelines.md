## Setup guidelines
These are the setup guidelines

How to start
And then...

### Rule 1: Start with all functions disabled
If you have just installed this flow for the first time, it is likely you are used to a very simple control. You might have already figured out an operating window which gives you comfort in your home. 

So, please start with that. 

Why? You need to:<br>
- make sure the very basics are working as expected
- build a feel and insights on the 'default' operation

Only after you have confidence the dashboard is working correctly, continue with the next steps.

### Rule 2: Enable functions one-by-one
Do not just enable all functions after first start and assume it works. You need to configure each function and verify it is working according to your expectation.<br>
Once configured correctly, wait and look at the result for a couple of days. 

Only after you have verified the function is working correctly and as desired, continue with the next. 

### Rule 3: If you think a function is behaving badly, disable the function
Sometimes it appears as if a function is not working as designed. Very easily it is concluded the function is at fault. <br>
First verify it is the function that is at fault by disabling the function.

> Example:
> If you think you have too short compressor-runs and suspect the SoftStart function is at fault, disable it and see what the behaviour is without it.

### The custom functions
There are a number of custom functions in the dashboard. Some of these functions work independantly of another function, while other functions build ontop of eachother.
