<br>

<ins>And on the human side:</ins>
- Time
- Patience
- Some IT awareness and interest
<br>

These items are the most basic things you need to have.<br>
The installation process these items are documented well in other places like youtube or various forums, or you can search for this. Anything written here will be out of date quickly anyway.<br>

<ins>You do not require:</ins>
- a database backend
- Home Assistant *1

_1: To clarify; Although it is possible to have Node Red installed as App inside of Home Assistant, Home Assistant itself is not required._
