## Requirements
**What do I need to make use of this flow?**<br/>

From looking at the diagram in the introduction page you could notice you require some basic things.

<ins>You require:</ins>
1. The heishamon module
2. A functional MQTT broker. ([Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)/[HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/)/[EMQX](https://www.emqx.io/)/etc.)  
3. A functional Node Red instance.
   
These items are the most basic things you need to have installed and operational. <br>
The installation process these items are documented well in other places like youtube or various forums, or you can search for this. Anything written here will be out of date quickly anyway. 

<ins>You do not require:</ins>
1. a database backend
2. Home Assistant *1

_1: To clarify; Although it is possible to have Node Red installed as App inside of Home Assistant, Home Assistant itself is not required._
