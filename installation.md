The installation has been split into two parts.
1. Node Red requirements
2. 

<a id="requirements"></a>
## Requirements on the Node Red install:<br/>

A - Persistent storage.<br>
B - Required Node Red libraries/pallets<br>
C - TimeZone setup<br>
D - Write to disk frequency (optional)<br>

### Persistant storage
Make sure Node Red is installed with persistent local volume available. <br/>
If you have Node Red running directly inside Linux (not using docker) or on a RPI, this is already okay and you don't need to create a data folder.
If you have Node Red running in a docker container, make sure you install with this parameter:
```
-v FOLDER:/data
```
Here you can choose the name "FOLDER" yourself which will be the local storage folder of NR.<br/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Test and verify if persistent storage is working correctly and see that all settings *stick* after a reboot of Node Red.
> Check if you can find context store "file" within Node Red.


<br/>	
### Adjust settings.js
You need to change some settings in settings.js<br/>
Why? If you reboot node red, you will notice some of the variables are not populated yet. Setpoints we have programmed earlier are gone. To make them persistent after reboots, you have to enable the local storage option. Below I have set the flush interval (write to disk) to 300s. 

In a (proxmox) docker install, you can find this settings.js file in:
```
/var/lib/docker/volumes/FOLDER/_data
```
where 'FOLDER' is your own folder name chosen in part A. 

On a Raspberry Pi, you can find this settings.js file here:
```
/home/pi/.node-red/settings.js".
```

Search for contextStorage:
Put in the text as below:
```
contextStorage: {
	default: "memoryOnly",
	memoryOnly: { module: 'memory' },
	file: { module: 'localfilesystem', config: {flushInterval: '300'}, }
},
```
Reboot Node Red for the changes to load.<br/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please also note that this flow writes to disk every 5 minutes. Storage on sd-card is not advised because of possible high wear levels.

### Timezone setup
If you use a linux version, make sure you set your correct timezone. You can do this by running this command from CLI root and go through the setup process.
```
dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
```
You can check if it was successful by executing this command
```
timedatectl 
```
If you are running Node Red from within HomeAssistant, follow the instructions from HomeAssistant on how to do that.

### Required Node Red libraries/pallets
To make use of the dashboard functionality, you need to install the dashboard library.<br/>
https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard <br/>
The scheduler makes use of the moment lib.<br/>
https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-moment <br/>
node-red-contrib-noop is used as well <br/>
https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-noop <br/>
node-red-contrib-dashboard-bar-chart-data (from v13+)<br/>
https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-dashboard-bar-chart-data <br/>
node-red-node-smooth (from 20+)<br/>
https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-node-smooth<br/>
